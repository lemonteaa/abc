# abc - Advanced Baseline for Clojure(script)

Refer to https://gist.github.com/lemonteaa/7165a89442eed5c850c54934aaa01eaf for the plan.

Currently copying code from the respective repo and making small modification, not yet tested on a REPL.

What it should do (when done):

- JSONSchema validation (via malli using the experimental PR)
- Using xtdb as underlying database
- Support auth using buddy-auth
- Support GraphQL via lacinia and lacinia-pedestal
- Routing that's ready for frontend too (thanks to reitit)
